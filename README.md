# Cafe-Boulange Website

**Cafe-Boulange** is a fully responsive single-page front-end project simulating a modern café and bakery storefront. The site showcases a complete UI/UX workflow from design to development using semantic HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, with a focus on responsive design, clean code structure, and interactive JavaScript features.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates core front-end engineering skills without the use of external frameworks. Starting by creating a custom design prototyped in **Figma**, the site was implemented with an emphasis on semantic markup, responsive styling, and lightweight interactivity.

## Key Technical Features

### HTML5

* Semantic structure supporting accessibility and SEO.
* Proper use of `alt` attributes and ARIA state indicators where applicable.

### CSS3

* **Responsive design** using media queries for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
* Custom typography integrated via `@font-face`.
* Centralized color theming using CSS custom properties (:root) for maintainable and scalable design consistency.
* **Normalize.css** and **reset.css** for cross-browser consistency.
* Flexbox layout techniques.
* Clear and semantic class naming for layout and styling.

### JavaScript (ES6+)

* **Parallax scrolling**: Dynamic background movement tied to scroll position.
* **Mobile navigation toggle**: ARIA state management for responsive menu visibility.
* **Carousel/product display**: Custom DOM manipulation and event handling to cycle featured content.

### UI/UX Design

* Visual design prototyped and iterated in **Figma**.
* Layout and color scheme reflecting a modern, inviting café aesthetic.
* Intuitive, scroll-based navigation.

### Performance

* Compressed and optimized image assets.
* Minimal external dependencies for fast load times.
