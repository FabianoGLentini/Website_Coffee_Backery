# Cafe-Boulange Website

Welcome to the **Cafe-Boulange** website — a polished fictional storefront crafted as a frontend design and development showcase. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the site brings a charming café and bakery experience to life with an emphasis on clean design and responsive layout.

**Live Website:** [Cafe-Boulange on GitHub Pages](https://fabianoglentini.github.io/Website_Coffee_Backery/)

While some links (such as social media icons) are placeholders, the site demonstrates full UI structure, design fidelity, and front-end coding capability for small business scenarios.
