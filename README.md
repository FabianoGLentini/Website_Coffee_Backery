Cafe-Boulange Website
Cafe-Boulange

Welcome to the Cafe-Boulange website repository! This is a fictional storefront website I designed using Figma and coded using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Some anchor tags, such as the social media icons, are left empty as it is a fictional store. I have plans to enhance the website with additional pages and features in the near future.

Planned Additions to the Website
Hiring Page
Dedicated Location Page
Dedicated Product Display Page
More Interactive Functionalities
Figma Design
