# Cafe-Boulange Website

![Cafe-Boulange](https://github.com/FabianoGLentini/Website_Coffee_Backery/assets/132173298/120ad1b0-2d51-466c-8073-ce841135f1e4)

Welcome to the Cafe-Boulange website repository! This is a fictional storefront website I designed using Figma and coded using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Some anchor tags, such as the social media icons, are left empty as it is a fictional store. I have plans to enhance the website with additional pages and features in the near future.

## Planned Additions to the Website

- Hiring Page
- Dedicated Location Page
- Dedicated Product Display Page
- More Interactive Functionalities

## Figma Design
