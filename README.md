#Cafe-Boulange Website

##Website for a fictional bakery store 

A fictional storefront website I designed using figma and coded using CSS, HTML and JS. Some anchor tags are empty such as the social media icons, as it is a fictional store. I plan to add more pages and features to the website in the near future.

###Planed addition to the website:
Hiring page
Dedicated page for location
Dedicated page for product display
And more interactive functionalities to the website

###My Figma Design for the planned website:
